                        <p>
                        Ball State University Men's Club Soccer is a high-level soccer program that 
                        plays in the Midwest Alliance Soccer Conference (MASC). In previous years the
                        team was part of the Eastern division, playing against club soccer teams from 
                        Ohio University, Cincinnati, Dayton, Xavier and Miami of Ohio, as well as other
                        college and universities. 
                        <br/><br/> 
                        As of 2014 the Men's Club Soccer team has made a move to the MASC Central Division, 
                        in which the team's game schedule contains club teams from Indiana and Michigan. 
                        During the off-season and before the league starts in the fall the Cardinals compete in friendly 
                        matches against local Indiana clubs and universities. As a team the Cardinals participate 
                        as a part of Ball State's Community promoting the club team while also taking part in 
                        stadium clean ups, supporting the varsity girls school soccer team, also girls club team 
                        and any soccer related events that help promote Ball State Community and the team. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Beginning in 2012 the Cardinals have been working with the local youth club, Delware County 
                        Futbol Club. Members of the club team have been coaching a number of the youth teams, hoping 
                        to develop the youth in to great players in a community where soccer is still setting its roots. 
                        The rest speaks for its self, current soccer club players are giving back to the Muncie community 
                        by taking part in what they love, the greatest sport on earth, soccer.

                                The team will meet at the bus stop circle near Worthen Arena, and across from Johnson Dorms
                                roughly 20 minutes before the tryouts start. This allows us to show up as a team and make sure 
                                those without a means of transportation are able to make it to the fields.
                                
                                The team typically has a roster size of 22-24 players, 2-3 of which will be goal keepers.

                        <h3 class="center-text">Team Information</h3>
                        <p>
                        The Ball State club soccer team is a group of men dedicated to playing the sport and having fun. We currently play in the Central Division of the Midwest Alliance Soccer Conference,
                        with hopes of receiving our first ever Regional Tournament bid.<br/><br/>
                        The team practices somewhere between two to four times a week. This allows use to blend together multiple field types, as well as training styles. We as a team practice both indoors
                        and outdoors. These practices are usually between 6:00-8:00pm when outside, and usually after 8:00pm when indoors. At Ball State we are lucky to have an award-winning Student Recreation
                        Center, which includes an indoor turf field, an indoor hard court surface, and an outdoor training area. <br/><br/>
                        Dues for our club for the 2014-2015 Season will be $150 per player, this price includes the following: league membership due, uniforms, travel costs, referee dues, and other expenses such as gas 
                        and hotel fees. All BSU Sport Clubs are student funded, and over the past few years we have been working to lower our dues in order to allow more participation from students; however, 
                        we do rely on these membership dues to stay afloat. Donations are highly appreciated and make a major difference in what we are able to do as a club.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The Cardinals are more than just a team on the pitch, in the time off the field the Cardinals are working to show the Ball State and Muncie Community we want to help! Every year our team works with
                        local youth club, Delaware County Futbol Club, as coaches to provide the club with a new perspective in soccer. Many of our players are not from the Muncie area, this allows the teams to be coached
                        in a different style than they may be used to. This experience not only allows our players to gain leadership experience, but also continue doing something they love while giving back to the community.<br/><br/>
                        The team takes part in stadium clean-ups once or twice per semester, on campus to help Ball State University. The team also participates in the BSU Dance Marathon 
                        in order to raise funds for the Riley Children's Hospital. <br/><br/>
                        As a team we are looking to continue this streak of well-doing and if you are in need of able-bodied young men, feel free to <a href="#contact">contact us</a> below. 
                        We are always open to new ideas and ways we can help!
